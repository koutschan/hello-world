\section{Introduction}\label{SECT:intro}

The classical question in symbolic integration is whether the integral of
a given function can be written in ``closed form''. In its most restricted form,
the question is whether for a given function~$f$ belonging to some domain $D$
there exists another function~$g$, also belonging to~$D$, such that $f=g'$. For
example, if $D$ is the field of rational functions, then for $f=1/x^2$ we can
find $g=-1/x$, while for $f=1/x$ no suitable $g$ exists. When no $g$ exists
in~$D$, there are several other questions we may ask. One possibility is to ask
whether there is some extension~$E$ of $D$ such that in $E$ there exists some
$g$ with $g'=f$. For example, in the case of elementary functions, Liouville's
principle restricts the possible extensions~$E$, and algorithms have been
designed to construct these extensions whenever possible. Another possibility is
to ask whether for some modification $\tilde f\in D$ of~$f$ there exists a $g\in
D$ such that $\tilde f=g'$. Creative telescoping is a question of this
type. Here we are dealing with domains~$D$ containing functions in several
variables, say $x$ and~$t$, and the question is whether there is a linear
differential operator~$P$, nonzero and free of~$x$, such that there exists a
$g\in D$ with $P\cdot f=g'$, where $g'$ denotes the derivative of $g$ with
respect to~$x$. Typically, $g$~itself has the form $Q\cdot f$ for some operator
$Q$ (which may be zero and need not be free of~$x$). In this case, we call $P$
a telescoper for~$f$, and $Q$ a certificate for~$P$.

Creative telescoping is the backbone of definite integration. Readers not
familiar with this technique are refered to the literature~\cite{PWZbook1996,Zeilberger1990c,Zeilberger1991,Zeilberger1990,Koepf1998}
for motivation, theory, algorithms, implementations, and applications. There are
several ways to find telescopers for a given $f\in D$. In recent years, an
approach has become popular which has the feature that it can find a telescoper
without also constructing the corresponding certificate. This is interesting
because certificates tend to be much larger than telescopers, and in some
applications only the telescoper is of interest. This approach was first
formulated for rational functions $f\in C(t,x)$ in~\cite{BCCL2010} and later
generalized to rational functions in several variables~\cite{bostan13}, to
hyperexponential functions~\cite{bostan13a} and, for the shift case, to hypergeometric
terms~\cite{chen15a} and binomial sums~\cite{bostan15}. In the present paper, we will extend
the approach to fuchsian D-finite functions.

The basic principle of the general approach is as follows. Assume that the
$x$-constants $\mathrm{Const}_x(D)=\{\,c\in D:c'=0\,\}$ form a field, i.e., that $D$
is a vector space over the field of $x$-constants. Assume further that there is
some $\mathrm{Const}_x(D)$-linear map $[\cdot]\colon D\to D$ such that for every
$f\in D$ there exists a $g\in D$ with $f-[f]=g'$. Such a map is called a
\emph{reduction.} For example, in $D=C(t,x)$ Hermite reduction produces for
every $f\in D$ some $g$ such that $f-g'$ is either zero or a rational function
with a square-free denominator. In this case, we can take $[f]=f-g'$.
In order to find a telescoper, we can compute $[f]$, $[\partial_t\cdot f]$, $[\partial_t^2\cdot f]$, \dots,
until we find that they are linearly dependent over $\mathrm{Const}_x(D)$.
When we find a relation
$p_0[f] + \cdots + p_r[\partial_t^r\cdot f] = 0$,
then, by linearity,
$[p_0 f + \cdots + p_r \partial_t^r\cdot f] = 0$,
and then, by definition of $[\cdot]$, there exists a $g\in D$ such that $(p_0+\cdots + p_r\partial_t^r)\cdot f=g'$.
In other words, $P=p_0+\cdots + p_r\partial_t^r$ is a telescoper.

There are two ways to guarantee that this method works. The first consists in
showing that $\{\,[f]:f\in D\,\}$ is a finite-dimensional vector space over
$\mathrm{Const}_x(D)$. This approach was taken in~\cite{BCCL2010,bostan13a}. It has the
nice additional feature that every bound for the dimension of this vector space
gives rise to a bound for the order of the telescoper. In particular, it implies
the existence of a telescoper. The second way requires that we already know for
other reasons that a telescoper exists. The idea is then to show that the
reduction $[\cdot]$ has the property that when $f\in D$ is such that there
exists a $g\in D$ with $g'=f$, then $[f]=0$. If this is the case and
$P=p_0+\cdots+p_r\partial_t^r$ is a telescoper for~$f$, then $P\cdot f$ is integrable
in~$D$, so $[P\cdot f]=0$, and by linearity $[f]$, \dots, $[\partial_t^r\cdot f]$ are
linearly dependent over $\mathrm{Const}_x(D)$. This means that the method won't
miss any telescoper. In particular, this argument has the nice feature that we
are guaranteed to find a telescoper of smallest possible order~$r$. This
approach was taken in~\cite{chen15a}.

Using an analog of Trager's Hermite reduction for algebraic
functions~\cite{trager84,geddes92}  adapted to fuchsian D-finite functions, we provide an
algorithm for finding the minimal order telescoper in Section~\ref{sec:hermite} using the
first argument. We then proceed to describe in Section~\ref{sec:polynomial} an additional
reduction which in combination with the Hermite reduction ensures that the
remainders live in a finite-dimensional vector space.
This gives a new proof of a bound for the order of the telescopers,
and in particular an independent proof for their existence.

\section{Fuchsian D-finite Functions}

Let $C$ be a field. We consider linear differential operators
$L=\ell_0+\cdots+\ell_n\partial_x^n$ with $\ell_0,\dots,\ell_n$ belonging to some ring
$R$ containing~$C$.
Typical choices for $R$ will be $C[x]$ or~$C(x)$.
When $\ell_n\neq0$, we say that $\ord(L):=n$ is the order of~$L$.

We write $R[\partial_x]$ for the algebra consisting of all these operators, together
with the usual addition and the unique non-commutative multiplication satisfying
$\partial_xc=c\partial_x$ for all $c\in C$ and $\partial_xx=x\partial_x+1$.
The algebra $R[\partial_x]$ acts on a differential $R$-module~$F$ via
\[
  (\ell_0+\ell_1\partial_x+\cdots+\ell_n\partial_x^n)\cdot f=
   \ell_0f + \ell_1f' + \cdots + \ell_n f^{(n)}.
\]
An element $y\in F$ is called a solution of an operator $L\in R[\partial_x]$ if
$L\cdot y=0$.

By $\bar C$ we denote some algebraically closed field containing~$C$ (not necessarily the smallest). 
An operator $L$ of order~$r$ is called fuchsian at a point $a\in\bar C$ if
it admits $r$ linearly independent solutions in
\[
  C[[[x-a]]] := \bigcup_{\nu\in C} (x-a)^\nu\bar C[[x-a]][\log(x-a)].
\]
It is called fuchsian at $\infty$ if it admits $r$ linearly independent solutions in
\[
  C[[[x^{-1}]]] := \bigcup_{\nu\in C} x^{-\nu} \bar C[[x^{-1}]][\log(x)].
\]
It it simply called \emph{fuchsian} if it is fuchsian at all $a\in\bar C\cup\{\infty\}$.
Note that the exponents $\nu$ are restricted to~$C$, not to the larger field~$\bar C$.

For a fixed fuchsian operator $L$, we will consider the left $R[\partial_x]$-module
$A=R[\partial_x]/\<L>$, where $\<L>$ denotes the left ideal generated by~$L$ in
$R[\partial_x]$.  Then $1\in A$ is a solution of~$L$, because we have $L\cdot 1=L=0$
in~$A$. We can say that $A$ consists of all the ``functions'' $f$ which can be
obtained from a ``generic'' solution~$y$ of $L$ by applying some operator $P\in
R[\partial_x]$ to it. When $R$ is a field, then $A$ is an $R$-vector space of
dimension~$r=\ord(L)$, generated by $1,\partial_x,\dots,\partial_x^{r-1}$.

It is instructive to compare this setup to the situation for algebraic
functions. Comparing $A=R[\partial_x]/\<L>$ to an algebraic function field $R[Y]/\<M>$
(when $R$ is a field), our operator $L$ plays the role of the minimal
polynomial~$M$. In the algebraic case, $Y$~is a formal solution of the equation
$M=0$, similar as $1\in A$ is a formal solution of~$L$. Besides these formal
solutions there are, for each fixed $a\in\bar C$, exactly $\deg_Y(M)$ different
Puiseux series solutions of $M=0$ at places above~$a$. They correspond in the
differential setting to the series solutions of $L$ in $\bar C[[[x-a]]]$, which
generate a $\bar C$-vector space of dimension $\ord(L)$.

In the context of creative telescoping, we let $\bar C$ be some algebraically
closed field containing the rational function field $K=C(t)$, and we
use $R=K(x)$ instead of~$C(x)$. Integration will always be with respect to~$x$, but
besides the derivation $\partial_x$ there is now also the derivation with respect
to~$t$. The notation $f'$ will always refer to the derivative of $f$
with respect to~$x$. In addition to the operator algebra $R[\partial_x]$, we consider the
operator algebra $R[\partial_x,\partial_t]$, in which $\partial_x,\partial_t$
commute with each other (although they need not commute with elements of~$R$).

The action of $R[\partial_x]$ on $C[[[x-a]]]$ or $C[[[x^{-1}]]]$ is extended
to $R[\partial_t,\partial_x]$ by letting $\partial_t$ act coefficient-wise.
To extend the action of $R[\partial_x]$ on $A=R[\partial_x]/\<L>$ to an action of
$R[\partial_t,\partial_x]$ on~$A$, we assume that there is some other
operator $\tilde L\in R[\partial_x]$ such that $\partial_t\cdot1=\tilde L\cdot 1$.
In order to have a well-defined action of $R[\partial_x,\partial_t]$ on some module~$F$,
we need to have
\[
\partial_x\cdot(\partial_t\cdot f)=(\partial_x\partial_t)\cdot f=(\partial_t\partial_x)\cdot f=\partial_t\cdot(\partial_x\cdot f)
\]
for all $f\in F$. It is clear that this is satisfied for the action on series domains,
but for the proposed action on $A$ it implies an implicit restriction on the possible
choices of~$\tilde L$. Even worse, for some $L$ it may be that no $\tilde L$ exists.
Note that this is different from the case of algebraic function fields, where a single minimal polynomial $M$
suffices even in the case of several variables.
In the differential case, the requirement that $\tilde L$ exists amounts to saying that the element $1\in A$ is
D-finite with respect to the action of $R[\partial_x,\partial_t]$, for if its annihilator $\mathfrak{a}$
contains the operators $L$ and $\partial_t-\tilde L$, then we have $\dim\mathfrak{a}=0$, and this is the usual
definition of D-finiteness in the case of several variables~\cite{zeilberger90,chyzak98,koutschan09,kauers14c}.

\section{Integral Bases}

Trager's Hermite reduction for algebraic functions rests on the notion of
integral bases. The notion of integral bases has been generalized to D-finite
functions last year~\cite{kauers15b}, and an algorithm was also given there for
computing such bases. We recall here the relevant definitions and properties.

Although the elements of a generalized series ring $C[[[x-a]]]$ are formal
objects, the series notation suggests certain analogies with complex
functions.  For simplicity, let us assume throughout that $C\subseteq\set
R$. Terms $(x-a)^\alpha\log(x-a)^\beta$ or $(\tfrac1x)^\alpha\log(x)^\beta$ are
called \emph{integral} if $\alpha>0$ or $\alpha=\beta=0$.
Integrality thus means that the corresponding complex
function does not diverge at the reference point~$a$ (the reference point is
$\infty$ in the case of $(\tfrac1x)^\alpha\log(x)^\beta$). A series in
$C[[[x-a]]]$ or $C[[[x^{-1}]]]$ is called integral if it only contains integral
terms. A non-integral series is said to have a \emph{pole} at the reference
point.  Note that in this terminology also $1/\sqrt{x}$ and $\log(x)$ have
``poles'' at~$0$, although the usual terminology reserves the word pole for
asymptotic behaviour which agrees with $x^n$ for some negative integer~$n$.

Note also that integrality at $a\in\bar C$ is not preserved by differentiation,
but if $f$ is integral at~$a$, then so is $(x-a)f'$. Somewhat conversely,
integrality at infinity is preserved by differentiation, we even have that
when $f$ is integral at infinity, then not only $f'$ but also $xf'$ is
integral at infinity. 

Let $K$ be some field with $C\subseteq K\subseteq\bar C$. 
Let $L\in K(x)[\partial_x]$ be a fuchsian operator. An element $f\in A=K(x)[\partial_x]/\<L>$
is called (locally) integral at $a\in\bar C\cup\{\infty\}$ if for every solution $y$
of $L$ in $C[[[x-a]]]$ or $C[[[x^{-1}]]]$, respectively, the series $f\cdot y$ is
integral. $f$~is called (globally) integral if it is locally integral at every
$a\in\bar C$ (``at all finite places''). Because of the Fuchs relation~\cite{ince26}, an
element $f\in A$ is integral at every $a\in\bar C\cup\{\infty\}$ if and only if it
is a constant (i.e., if $\partial_xf=0$ in~$A$).

The set of all integral elements $f\in A$ forms a $K[x]$-submodule of~$A$.
A basis $\{\omega_1,\dots,\omega_n\}$ of this module is called an \emph{integral basis}
for~$A$. In~\cite{kauers15b} an algorithm was given which computes an integral basis
for a given~$A$. This algorithm is a generalization of van Hoeij's
algorithm~\cite{vanHoeij94} for computing integral bases of algebraic function
fields.

For a fixed $a\in\bar C$, let $\bar C(x)_a$ be the ring of rational functions $p/q$
with $q(a)\neq0$, and write $\bar C(x)_\infty$ for the ring of all
rational functions $p/q$ with $\deg_x(p)\leq\deg_x(q)$.
Then the set of all $f\in A$ which are locally integral at some
fixed $a\in\bar C\cup\{\infty\}$ forms a $\bar C(x)_a$-module. A basis of this module is
called a \emph{local integral basis} at $a$ for~$A$. The algorithm given in~\cite{kauers15b}
for computing (global) integral bases computes local integral bases at finite
points as an intermediate step. The computation of a local integral basis at
infinity is also possible, either analogously, or by making a change of
variables $\tilde x=1/x$ and computing a local integral basis at~$0$.

An integral basis $\omega_1,\dots,\omega_n$ is always also a $K(x)$-vector space
basis of~$A$. A key feature of integral bases is that they make poles explicit. Writing
an element $f\in A$ as a linear combination $f=\sum_{i=1}^n f_i\omega_i$ for some
$f_i\in K(x)$, we have that $f$ has a pole at $a\in\bar C$ if and only if at least one
of the $f_i$ has a pole there.

\begin{lemma}\label{lemma:1}
  Let $L$ be a fuchsian operator and let
  $\omega_1,\dots,\omega_n$ be a local integral basis of $A=K(x)[\partial_x]/\<L>$ at $a\in\bar C\cup\{\infty\}$.
  Let $f\in A$ and $f_1,\dots,f_n\in K(x)$ be such that $f=\sum_{i=1}^nf_i\omega_i$.
  Then $f$ is integral at $a$ if and only if each $f_i\omega_i$ is integral at~$a$.
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
  The direction ``$\Rightarrow$'' is obvious. To show ``$\Leftarrow$'', suppose
  that $f$ is integral at~$a$. Then there exist $w_1,\dots,w_n\in\bar C(x)_a$ such that
  $f=\sum_{i=1}^nw_i\omega_i$. Thus $\sum_{i=1}^n(w_i-f_i)\omega_i=0$, and then
  $w_i=f_i$ for all $i$, because $\omega_1,\dots,\omega_n$ is a basis.
  As elements of $\bar C(x)_a$, the $f_i$ are integral at~$a$, and hence also all the $f_i\omega_i$
  are integral at~$a$.
\end{proof}

The lemma says in particular that poles of the $f_i$ in a linear combination
$\sum_{i=1}^n f_i\omega_i$ have no chance to cancel each other.

\begin{lemma}\label{lemma:e}
  Let $L$ be a fuchsian operator and let
  $\omega_1,\dots,\omega_n$ be an integral basis of $A=K(x)[\partial_x]/\<L>$.
  Let $e\in K[x]$ and
  $M=((m_{i,j}))_{i,j=1}^n\in K[x]^{n\times n}$ be such that
  \[
    e\,\omega_i'=\sum_{j=1}^n m_{i,j}\omega_j
  \]
  for $i=1,\dots,n$ and $\gcd(e,m_{1,1},\dots,m_{n,n})=1$.
  Then $e$ is square-free.
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
  Let $a$ be a root of~$e$. We show that $a$ is not a multiple root.
  Since $\omega_i$ is integral, it is in particular locally integral at~$a$.
  Therefore $(x-a)\omega_i'$ is locally integral at~$a$.
  Since $\omega_1,\dots,\omega_n$ is an integral basis, it follows that
  $(x-a)m_{i,j}/e\in\bar C(x)_a$ for all~$i,j$.
  Because of $\gcd(e,m_{1,1},\dots,m_{n,n})=1$, no factor $x-a$ of $e$
  can be canceled by all the~$m_{i,j}$.
  Therefore the factor $x-a$ can appear in $e$ only once.
\end{proof}

\begin{lemma} \label{lemma:degM}
  Let $L$ be a fuchsian operator and let $\omega_1,\dots,\omega_n$ be a local integral
  basis at infinity of $A=K(x)[\partial_x]/\<L>$. Let $e\in K[x]$ and $M=((m_{i,j}))_{i,j=1}^n\in K[x]^{n\times n}$
  be defined as in Lemma~\ref{lemma:e}. Then $\deg_x(m_{i,j})<\deg_x(e)$ for all $i,j$.
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
  Since every $\omega_i$ is local integral at infinity, so is every $x\,\omega_i'$.
  Since $\omega_1,\dots,\omega_n$ is an integral basis at infinity, it follows that
  $xm_{i,j}/e\in\bar C(x)_\infty$ for all~$i,j$. This means that $1+\deg_x(m_{i,j})\leq\deg_x(e)$
  for all~$i,j$, and therefore $\deg_x(m_{i,j})<\deg_x(e)$, as claimed.
\end{proof}

A $K(x)$-vector space basis $\omega_1,\dots,\omega_n$ of $A=K(x)[\partial_x]/\<L>$ is
called \emph{normal} at $a\in\bar C\cup\{\infty\}$ if there exist $r_1,\dots,r_n\in
K(x)$ such that $r_1\omega_1,\dots,r_n\omega_n$ is a local integral basis
at~$a$. Trager shows for the case of algebraic function fields how to construct
an integral basis which is normal at infinity from a given integral basis and
a given local integral basis at infinity~\cite{trager84}. The same procedure also applies
in the present situation. % It works as follows.

/// MK: I WILL ADD THIS IN THE END, IF SPACE PERMITS. OTHERWISE WE DROP IT. 

Although normality is a somewhat weaker condition on a basis than integrality,
it also excludes the possibility that poles in the terms of a linear combination
of basis elements can cancel:

\begin{lemma}\label{lemma:3}
  Let $L$ be a fuchsian operator and let $\omega_1,\dots,\omega_n$ be an integral basis of $A=K(x)[\partial_x]/\<L>$
  which is normal at infinity.
  Let $f=\sum_{i=1}^n f_i\omega_i$ for some $f_1,\dots,f_n\in K[x]$.
  Then $f$ has a pole at infinity if and only if
  there is some $i$ such that $f_i\omega_i$ has a pole at infinity.
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
  Let $r_1,\dots,r_n\in K(x)$ be such that $r_1\omega_1,\dots,r_n\omega_n$ is a
  local integral basis at infinity. By $f=\sum_{i=1}^n
  (f_ir_i^{-1})(r_i\omega_i)$ and by Lemma~\ref{lemma:1}, $f$~is integral at infinity iff all
  $f_ir_i^{-1}r_i\omega_i=f_i\omega_i$ are integral at infinity.
\end{proof}

\section{Hermite Reduction}\label{sec:hermite}

Hermite reduction and its generalizations are the key step in many integration
algorithms, including the telescoping algorithm presented in this paper. It
turns out that the Hermite reduction for fuchsian D-finite functions is
literally the same as Trager's reduction for algebraic
functions~\cite{trager84}.

We start with a technical lemma, which is needed later to ensure that the
Hermite reduction always works. The analogous statement for algebraic
functions and its proof can be found in~\cite[pp. 46--47]{trager84}; for
sake of self-containedness, we give the full proof here, although it is a
straightforward generalization of Trager's proof.

Throughout this section, let $L\in K(x)[\partial_x]$ be a fuchsian operator
of order~$n$ and let $A=K(x)[\partial_x]/\<L>$.

\begin{lemma}\label{lemma:ibv}
Let $\{\omega_1,\ldots,\omega_n\}$ be an integral basis of~$A$.
Moreover, let $u,v\in K[x]$ be such that $uv\omega_i'$ is
integral for $1\leq i\leq n$ and $\gcd(u,v)=\gcd(v,v')=1$.  For some integer
$m>1$ we define $\psi_i:=uv^m(\omega_i/v^{m-1})'$; then
$\{\psi_1,\ldots,\psi_n\}$ is a local integral basis at each root $a\in\bar C$ of~$v$.
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
By expanding $\psi_i=uv\omega_i'-(m-1)uv'\omega_i$ one sees that the $\psi_i$
themselves are integral elements. We 
have to show that each integral element can be expressed as a linear
combination of the $\psi_i$ with coefficients in $\bar C(x)_a$. To the contrary, 
assume that there exists an integral element~$f$ that requires $x-a$ in the
denominator of some coefficient, i.e.,
\[
  f = \frac{1}{v} \sum_{i=1}^n c_i \psi_i \quad\text{with }c_i\in \bar{C}(x)_a
  \text{ and } c_i(a)\neq0 \text{ for some } i
\]
(here we use the fact that $v$ is squarefree).  Further let $g=\sum_{i=1}^n
(c_iu)'\omega_i$, which is obviously integral. Then also their sum
\begin{align*}
  f+g &= v^{m-1} \sum_{i=1}^n \left(c_iu \left(\frac{\omega_i}{v^{m-1}}\right)'
  + (c_iu)'\frac{\omega_i}{v^{m-1}} \right) \\
  &= v^{m-1} \sum_{i=1}^n \left(\frac{uc_i\omega_i}{v^{m-1}}\right)'
\end{align*}
must be integral. Since $\{\omega_1,\ldots,\omega_n\}$ is an integral basis,
there exists for each $\omega_i$ a series solution $y\in C[[[x-a]]]$ with
$L\cdot y=0$ such that $\omega_i\cdot y$ involves a term
$T=(x-a)^\alpha\log(x-a)^\beta$ with $0\leq\alpha<1,\beta=0$ or
$0<\alpha\leq1,\beta>0$. Let $i$ be an index such that $c_i(a)\neq0$; together
with $\gcd(u,v)=1$ this implies that $T$ appears in $(uc_i\omega_i)\cdot
y$. Using the fact that the $\omega_i$ form an integral basis, it follows that
$T$ is also present in $h\cdot y$ where $h=\sum_{i=1}^n uc_i\omega_i$. {\red
  (TODO: clear?  justification needed?)}  Applying the operator
$v^{m-1}\partial_xv^{1-m}$ to $h\cdot y$ turns $T$ into
$(x-a)^{\alpha-1}\log(x-a)^\beta$, which reveals that
$v^{m-1}(h/v^{m-1})'=f+g$ is not integral. This contradicts our assumption of
$f$ being integral, and hence $\{\psi_1,\ldots,\psi_n\}$ is a local integral
basis at~$a$.
\end{proof}

Let $\{\omega_1,\ldots,\omega_n\}$ be an integral basis for~$A$.
Further let $e,m_{i,j}\in K[x]$ ($1\leq i,j\leq n$) be such that
$e\omega_i'=\sum_{j=1}^n m_{i,j}\omega_i$ and
$\gcd(e,m_{1,1},m_{1,2},\ldots,m_{n,n})=1$. For describing the Hermite
reduction we fix a D-finite ``function'' $f\in A$ and represent it using the
integral basis, i.e., $f=\sum_{i=1}^n (f_i/d)\,\omega_i$ with
$d,f_1,\ldots,f_n\in K[x]$. As differentiating the $\omega_i$ can introduce
denominators, namely the factors of~$e$, it is convenient to consider those
denominators from the very beginning on, and this means that we want to assume
$e\mid d$. Additionally we assume that $d$ is the polynomial of lowest degree
satisfying these properties. % TODO: Do we really need this?
Note that $\gcd(d,f_1,\ldots,f_n)$ may be nontrivial.

Let $m$ be the highest multiplicity of some root of~$d$, i.e., there is no
polynomial~$w$ of positive degree such that $w^\ell\mid d$ for some $\ell>m$.
Write $d=uv^m$ with $u,v\in K[x]$ and where $v$ is squarefree of positive
degree.  It follows that $\gcd(u,v)=1$ and $\gcd(v,v')=1$. By
Lemma~\ref{lemma:e} the polynomial~$e$ is squarefree and therefore $e\mid uv$.
A single step of the Hermite reduction consists of lowering the multiplicity
of~$v$ in the denominator by subtracting a suitable integrable function
from~$f$. More precisely, the input function~$f$ is decomposed as follows:
\begin{equation}\label{eq:hred}
  \sum_{i=1}^n \frac{f_i}{uv^m}\omega_i =
  \biggl(\sum_{i=1}^n\frac{g_i}{v^{m-1}}\omega_i\biggr)' +
  \sum_{i=1}^n \frac{h_i}{uv^{m-1}}\omega_i.
\end{equation}
In order to determine the unknown polynomials $g_1,\ldots,g_n$, the
denominator $uv^m$ in the above equation is cleared
\[
  \sum_{i=1}^n f_i\omega_i = \sum_{i=1}^n \biggl( uvg_i'\omega_i +
  uv^mg_i\left(\frac{\omega_i}{v^{m-1}}\right)' + vh_i\omega_i \biggr),
\]
and then the equation is reduced modulo~$v$:
\begin{equation}\label{eq:modv}
  \sum_{i=1}^n f_i\omega_i =
  \sum_{i=1}^n uv^mg_i\left(\frac{\omega_i}{v^{m-1}}\right)' \mod v.
\end{equation}
By Lemma~\ref{lemma:ibv} the elements $uv^m(\omega_i/v^{m-1})'$ form a local
integral basis, which implies that the coefficients $g_i$ are uniquely
determined.

Since $e\mid uv$ we can write $uv=ew$ for some $w\in K[x]$. By rewriting the
derivatives of the $\omega_i$ in terms of the integral basis,
Equation~\eqref{eq:modv} turns into
\begin{align*}
  \sum_{i=1}^n f_i\omega_i 
  &= \sum_{i=1}^n ug_i \bigl( v\omega_i' - (m-1)v'\omega_i \bigr) \mod v\\
  &= \sum_{i=1}^n g_i\, \biggl( w\sum_{j=1}^n m_{i,j}\omega_j - (m-1)uv'\omega_i \biggr) \mod v.
\end{align*}
Coefficient comparison with respect to $\omega_1,\ldots,\omega_n$ yields a
system of linear equations for $g_1,\ldots,g_n$. Note that $\deg_x(g_i)<\deg_x(v)$
since we are computing modulo~$v$. Finally, the remaining unknowns
$h_1,\ldots,h_n$ can be obtained from Equation~\eqref{eq:hred}.

By a repeated application of the reduction step described above
one can decompose any fuchsian D-finite function $f\in A$ as
$f=g'+h$ where $h=\sum_{i=1}^n (h_i/v)\,\omega_i$ has a squarefree
denominator~$v$. This gives rise to the reduction map $[f]=h$.

\begin{example}
TODO
\end{example}

\begin{theorem}\label{thm:intiff0}
Let $f\in A$ have a double root at
infinity, and let $B=\{\omega_1,\ldots,\omega_n\}$ be an integral basis for~$A$
that is normal at infinity.
% Then the Hermite remainder $[f]$ w.r.t.~$B$
If $f=g'+h$ is the result of the above-described Hermite reduction,
then $h$ is zero if and only if $f$ is integrable in~$A$.
\end{theorem}
\begin{proof}
The direction ``$\Rightarrow$'' is trivial. To show the implication
``$\Leftarrow$'' assume that $f$ is integrable. From $f=g'+h$ it follows that
also $h$ is integrable; let $H\in A$ be such that $H'=h$.  In order to show
that $h=0$, we show that $H$ is constant.  To show that $H$ is constant, we
show that it has neither finite poles nor a pole at infinity.

It is clear that $H$ has no finite poles because $h$ has only ``simple'' poles
(i.e., all series expansions of $h$ have only terms of the form
$(x-a)^{-1}$ or $(x-a)^\alpha\log(x-a)^\beta$ with $\alpha>-1$).

We will show below that when $H$ has a pole at infinity, then also $g+H$ must
have a pole at infinity.  Since $f=g'+h=(g+H)'$ has at least a double root at
infinity, $g+H$ has at least a single root at infinity. This excludes the
possibility that $H$ has a pole at infinity.

Assume now that $H$ has a pole at infinity. We show that $g+H$ has also a pole at infinity.
Since $H$ has no finite poles, $H$ is integral and we can write it as
$H=p_1\omega_1+\cdots+p_n\omega_n$ with $p_i\in C[x]$.
Since we assume that $H$ has a pole at infinity, it follows by Lemma~\ref{lemma:3} that
(a) one of the $p_i$ has positive degree or
(b) some non-constant $\omega_i$ has a nonzero coefficient~$p_i$.
From how the Hermite reduction works, we know that $g=\sum_i g_i\omega_i$
with proper rational functions~$g_i$. Consider now $g+H=\sum_i (g_i+p_i)\omega_i$.
In case (a) there is some $i$ for which $g_i+p_i$ has a pole at infinity,
and thus $(g_i+p_i)\omega_i$ has a pole at infinity (because $\omega_i$ has
no poles at finite places and therefore no zero at infinity).
In case (b), there is some $i$ with $p_i\neq0$ and $\omega_i$ is non-constant,
which implies that $(g_i+p_i)\omega_i$ has a pole at infinity.
In both cases, therefore, $g+H$ has a pole at infinity by Lemma~\ref{lemma:3}.
\end{proof}

Note that the condition in Theorem~\ref{thm:intiff0} that $f$ has a double
root at infinity is not a restriction at all, but it can always be achieved by
a suitable change of variables.  Let $a\in C$ be a regular point of $L$; by
the transformation $x\to1/x+a$ the regular point~$a$ is moved to
infinity. From
\[
  \int f(x) \,\mathrm{d}x = \int f\left(\frac{1}{x}+a\right)\left(-\frac{1}{x^2}\right) \mathrm{d}x
\]
we see that the new integrand has a double root at infinity.

///// MANUEL TO SHAOSHI: I don't want to mess around in your text in order to avoid
editing conflicts. please note that in view of having $t$ available in the ground
field for creative telescoping, I have changed $C$ to $K$ in the preceeding sections,
where $K=C(t)$, so that $C$ is really the constant field. Where you use $K$ below,
it should be $A$, and most of the $C$'s in your text should now be $K$'s. Once you
check in your next version to git, please wait for me to do the required changes in
your section before you continue editing. (Or do the changes yourself, if you don't

second approach: we wish to show that the hermite remainders belong to a finite-dimensional
vector space. in fact, this is not true.
note that the theorem does not imply that the hermite remainder is uniquely determined by
$f$ and the basis (it is not). it only makes a statement about the integrable case.

to make it true, we need to normalize the hermite remainder further. in view of the result
of the previous section, investing additional computational work seems pointless, because we have
already shown that repeated hermite reduction suffices to detect the minimal order telescoper.
in fact, the main point of the algorithm we discuss next is that it gives rise to a bound on
the telescoper. we will obtain an independent proof of the bound that already appeared in \cite{chen14a}.

Let $K= C(x, y)$ be a finite algebraic extension of degree~$n$ over~$C(x)$.
Assume that~$\Omega:=\{\omega_1, \ldots, \omega_n\}$ be an integral basis of~$K$
over~$C[x]$.  Assume that
\[\partial_x(\omega_i) = \frac{1}{e}\sum_{j=1}^n m_{i, j}\omega_j,\]
where~$e, m_{i, j}\in C[x]$ such that the gcd of~$e$ and~$m_{i,j}$'s is~$1$.
Set~$M=(m_{i, j})\in C[x]^{n\times n}$
and
\[\deg_x(M):= \max\{\deg_x(m_{i, j})\}\]
%%\begin{lemma}\label{LEM:M}
%%$Q$ is squarefree and~$\deg_x(M) <= \deg_x(Q)-1$.
%%\end{lemma}
%%\begin{proof}{\red To be proved...}
%%\end{proof}
Any element~$\alpha\in K$ can be written as
\[\alpha = \sum_{i=1}^n \frac{a_i\omega_i}{d},\]
where~$a_i, d\in C[x]$. Applying Hermite reduction to~$\alpha$, we get
\[\alpha = \partial_x(\beta) + \sum_{i=1}^n \frac{c_i\omega_i}{d^*e},\]
where~$\beta\in K$, $d^*, e, c_i\in C[x]$, $\gcd(d^*, e)=1$ and~$d^*$ is squarefree.
By the extended Euclidean algorithm, we compute~$u_i, v_i\in C[x]$ such that
$\deg_x(v_i) < \deg_x(d^*)$ and
\[c_i = u_i d^* + v_i Q.\]
Then we get
\[ \sum_{i=1}^n \frac{c_i\omega_i}{d^*e} =  \sum_{i=1}^n \left(\frac{u_i}{e} + \frac{v_i}{d^*}\right)\omega_i.\]
In order to control the number of supporting monomials of~$u_i$'s, we now introduce the polynomial reduction.

By Lemma~\ref{lemma:degM}, $\deg_x(M)\leq \deg_x(e)-1$.
We first rewrite the polynomial matrix~$M\in C[x]^{n\times n}$ as a polynomial in~$x$
with matrix coefficients of the form
\[M = m_{\deg_x(M)}x^{\deg_x(M)} + \ldots + m_0, \]
where~$m_i\in C^{n\times n}$. Define the map:
\[\phi: C[x]^n \rightarrow C[x]^n\]
by~$\phi(p)= e\partial_x(p) + Mp$ for any~$p\in C[x]^n$. This map is $C[x]$-linear.
The image~$\im(\phi)$ is a subspace of~$C[x]^n$ as a vector space over~$C$.
Let~$\{\ve_1, \ldots, \ve_n\}$ be the standard basis of~$C^n$. Then the $C$-vector space~$C[x]^n$
is spanned by
\[\cS := \{\ve_ix^j \mid 1\leq i \leq n, j\in \bN\}.\]
For any~$p \in C[x]^n$, we can always write as
\[p = \vp_sx^s + \cdots + \vp_0,\]
where~$\vp_i\in C^n$ and~$\vp_s \neq 0$. We call $\vp_sx^s$
the \emph{leading term} of~$p$ in~$x$ and~$\vp_s$ the corresponding \emph{leading coefficient},
denoted by~$\lt_x(p)$ and~$\lc_x(p)$, respectively.
Let~$N_\phi$ be the subspace of~$C[x]^n$ spanned by
\[\{t \in \cS \mid s\neq \lt(p) ~\text{for all~$p\in \im(\phi)$}. \}\]
Then~$C[x]^n = \im(\phi) \oplus N_\phi$. We call~$N_{\phi}$ the \emph{standard complement} of~$\im(\phi)$.
In the next, we will estimate the dimension of~$N_\phi$ as a vector space over~$C$.


\noindent {\it Case 1.}~$\mu := \deg_x(M)<\deg_x(e)-1$. Let~$p\in C[x]^n$ with~$s=\deg_x(p)$.
If~$s=0$, then~$\phi(p) = Mp$, which implies that~$\deg_x(\phi(p))\leq \mu$.
Let~$\cS_\mu := \{\ve_i x^j \mid i=1, \ldots, n, 0\leq j\leq \mu\}$, which forms a vector basis
for the subspace~$C[x]_\mu^n$ of elements of $C[x]^n$ with degree at most~$\mu$. All of the columns~$M_i\in C[x]^n$ of~$M$
can be expanded as vectors~$V_i$ in~$C^{n(1+\mu)}$ with respect to the basis~$\cS_\mu$. Let~$\tilde{M} = (V_1, \ldots, V_n)\in C^{n(1+\mu) \times n}$.
Then for any~$p\in C^n$, $\phi(p) \in \text{span}_C\{V_1, \ldots, V_n\}$. The intersection of the standard complement~$N_\phi$
and~$C[x]_\mu^n$ has dimension~$n(1+\mu)-\text{rank}(\tilde{M})$. If~$s>0$, then
\[\phi(p)=\lc(e)s\lc(p)x^{s+\deg_x(e)-1} +~ \text{lower terms in~$x$}.\]
Therefore, any element~$q\in C[x]^n$ of degree at least~$\deg_x(e)$ can be written as
$q = \phi(q_1) + q_2$ for some~$q_1, q_2\in C[x]^n$ such that~$\deg_x(q_2)\leq \deg_x(e)-1$.
Moreover, all of the monomials~$\ve_ix^j$ with~$i=1, \ldots, n$ and~$\mu+1\leq j\leq \deg_x(e)-1$
are in the standard complement~$N_\phi$. Together with the estimate of the case~$s=0$, the dimension of
$N_\phi$ is $n(\deg_x(e)-1)-\text{rank}(\tilde{M})$.


\noindent {\it Case 2.}~$\mu =\deg_x(M)=\deg_x(e)-1$. Then for any~$p\in C[x]^n$ with~$s=\deg_x(p)$, we have
\[\phi(p) = (s\lc(e) + m_{\mu})\lc(p)x^{s+\mu}+\text{lower terms in~$x$}.\]
If~$-s\lc(e)\in C$ is not an eigenvalue of~$m_{\mu}\in C^{n\times n}$, then
the matrix~$J_s = s\lc(e) + m_{\mu}$ is invertible and then $\ve_ix^{s+\mu}$ is not in~$N_\phi$
for any~$i=1, \ldots, n$. Since~$m_\mu$ has at most~$n$ eigenvalues, the dimension of~$N_\phi$
is therefore at most~$n^2+n(\deg_x(e)-1)$.

Now let us find a basis for~$N_\phi$. Let~$s_1, \ldots, s_\rho$ with~$\rho\leq n$ be distinct nonnegative integers such that
$-s_i\lc(e)$ is an eigenvalue of~$m_{d-1}$ for each~$i=1, \ldots, \rho$.
Without lose of generality,
we assume that~$s_1 <s_2<\ldots<s_\rho$. For any~$s_i$ and~$\vv\in C^n$, the monomial $\vv x^{s_i}$ is not in~$N_\phi$
if and only if the linear system~$J_{s_i}\vx = \vv$
has a nonzero solution. This implies that there are $\sum_{i=1}^\rho (n-\rank(J_{s_i}))$ many linearly
independent elements in the basis~$\cS$ are in~$N_\phi$. If~$\vv = J_{s_i} \vp$ for some~$\vp\in C^n$, then
$\vv x^{s_i}$ can be reduced to a monomial of degree {\red To be continued...}

\begin{prop}\label{prop:Nphi}
The standard complement~$N_\phi$ of~$\phi$ has finite dimension over~$C$. Moreover,
$\dim(N_\phi) \leq ...$
\end{prop}


\section{Creative Telescoping}

Explain how to represent $\partial_t^i$ in~$A$ using~$\tilde{L}$.
Describe creative telescoping.
If desired, the certificate can be computed by remembering the $g$ in each call of Hermite reduction.
If possible, present some timings/comparisons/examples.

double root persists by differentiating wrt. $t$. consequence: creative telescoping works.
(note: it is known that telescopers exist~\cite{zeilberger90,chyzak00}).
we find the minimal telescoper via hermite reduction by the trager-theorem.

// why does the shift case not work? answer: because $\partial_t$ has to be such that the representations of all the $\partial_t^i\cdot f$
with respect to the fixed chosen integral basis of the Hermite reduction have a finite common denominator.
(todo: show that this is the case in the differential case)
