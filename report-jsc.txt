SC: Yes, this is confusing. Maybe we could say that:
"The residual forms {[∂^i f] : i ∈ N} are linearly dependent by the external
existence of telescopers and the cannonical property. We now introduce polynomial reductions which decompose further
the residual forms computed by the previous reduction so that the new
residual forms are lying in a finitely dimensional vector space. This enables us to obtain an order bound
for telescopers and the existence of telescopers is achieved as an immediate consequence."

MK: I think we wanted to say that {[∂^i f] : i ∈ N} need not be finite dimensional
if the hypotheses of Theorem thm:intiff0 (integrand having a double root at infinity)
are not satisfied. Polynomial reduction does not require this assumption.

SC:  In fact, our proof of Prop. 19 implies an explicit bound for the dimension of N_V, which is

n(\tau + \delta + 1) (when \deg_x(B)<\delta) and n(\tau+\delta + \ell +1) (when \deg_x(B) = \delta).

The second bound can be improved by using the number t of s's such that -s\lc(e) is an
eigenvalue of \lc(B), that is  n(\tau + \delta + 1) + n*t (This avoids using the parameter \ell which maybe
arbitrary large nonnegative integer).

SC:  I could not understand how to use the idea of this referee to obtain an order bound.
We could discuss so that we know how to use this idea.

MK: done. I turned all three paragraphs into a remark consisting of three parts,
because I don't see why the observation in the first paragraph is "more important"
than the observations in the other two paragraphs. If we want to turn them into
formal propositions, we should also include formal proofs. I guess we don't want
this.

MK: added to the hermite citation (although, as far as I know, Ostrogradsky's
reduction is not quite the same).

MK: Where should we add this? We don't speak about the rational shift case.

MK: Also for these it's not so obvious how to add them. We cite Bostan16 for
"binomial sums", but this is a reduction based approach to multi-summation, which
is different from the Abramov/Petkovsek approach.
